Hello, this is **Salih Akdogan**

I am developing full-stack web projects using the technologies I categorized below and trying to become a web developer.

###  Front-End

    - CSS
- **Script languages**
    - JavaScript

    - React.js
    - TailwindCSS

### Back-End
- **Languages**
    - C#
    - JavaScript
- **Frameworks**

    - N-Layer Architecture
    - API

### Information and contact
- **Information**
    - If I say "I have learned 100% of the technologies I use," it would certainly be a lie. It would be more accurate to say that I have learned the aspects of these technologies that are relevant to my needs when developing a project.
    - Not every project that appears on my profile has been finished. I'm developing every project for learning a new technology. I update my previous works as I discover new technologies.
    - This categorization shows the general areas in which these technologies are commonly used. Of course, some technologies can fall into multiple categories, and the application of each technology can be much broader.
